# A Map Importer for sledders

## Makes it possible to import heightmaps in .raw format and load them in the game.

🔧 Installation guide:
* Download melon loader from https://melonwiki.xyz/
* Download MapImporter.dll and put it in the mods folder in sledders game folder
* Create a folder in mods folder called 'Maps' and put all your map files in there

🤨 How does it work?
* A menu should pop up with a height input which sets how high the terrain will be
* Clicking on Load Map will load the map

🛠️ How should the files look like?
* The file formats that are supported right know is .raw heightmaps and should ideally have a resolution of around 8000 * 8000 but lower resolutions should work
* It does also support my own heightmap format but will probably be scrapping it
